# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m ICPR `(icpr)`

Hello, I'm a second-year UofT undergraduate student studying computer science.

This profile contains all my projects so far. I try to make the projects on this page as pratically useful as possible, even to those without any programming experience. They speak for themselves.

Check out the projects I've made so far:

- [Timetable Tracker](https://icprplshelp.github.io/UofT-Enrollment-Tracker/) â€” a web app that displays a graph of enrollment in **most** UofT courses over time
- [Timetable Prototype](https://icprplshelp.github.io/UofT-Timetable-Prototype-V2/) â€” a web app that allows you to quickly view course information and scheduled meetings for **most** UofT courses in a concise way. UofT's official sites are very hard to navigate, and this app intends to resolve that.
- [MY CLASS NOTES](https://github.com/ICPRplshelp/UofT-Notes/) â€” all the notes I've taken in real time in class.
- [MS Word to LaTeX converter helper](https://github.com/ICPRplshelp/Quick-word-to-LaTeX-4/) â€” a python app I use with Pandoc to convert my Microsoft Word documents to fully functional LaTeX documents, so I can make professionally typeset documents with little to no effort.

## Skills

How good I'm at, when it comes to programming languages. Anything below two squares is not displayed here.
