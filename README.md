# 👋 Hi, I’m ICPR

This profile contains all my projects so far. I try to make the projects on this page as pratically useful as possible, even to those without any programming experience. They speak for themselves.

Check out the projects I've made so far:

- [Timetable/Enrollment Tracker](https://icprplshelp.github.io/UofT-Enrollment-Tracker/)
- [Timetable Prototype](https://icprplshelp.github.io/UofT-Timetable-Prototype-V2/)
- [MY CLASS NOTES](https://github.com/ICPRplshelp/UofT-Notes/)
